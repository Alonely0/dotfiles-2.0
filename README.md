What you'll see when there are no windows.

### Intelligent layout
This XMonad layout changes its algorithm depending on the number of windows, changing between `Tall` (normal tiling) and `Spiral` (fibonacci spiral) when there are more than 4 windows.

### Mirror + Tiled layout
This XMonad layout uses the `Tall` algorithm (normal tiling) modified with the Mirror preset, which creates an horizontal layout.

### Centered Master + Grid layout
This XMonad layout uses the `Grid` algorithm (grid-ish tiling) modified with the Centered Master preset, which creates a layout which puts all windows in a grid behind its master.

## Installation
Backup your dotfiles, and then move all the content of the repo except the `images` folder and this readme to your `~`. Then, compile XMonad with `xmonad --recompile`.

If you have a ROG laptop, you can use a little script included in the dotfiles that will let you set custom bindings to the keys like ROG logo and Aura RGB. For setting it up, install [asusctl](https://gitlab.com/asus-linux/asusctl) and [python3](https://python.org) and uncomment `.XMonad/XMonad.hs:277`. Edit `.config/rog_bindings.yaml` if you wanna set custom bindings. Recompile XMonad and you're done.

If you also want the Duckduckgo theme, go to your browser's settings and set your new tab URL to this: ```https://duckduckgo.com/?kae=-1&kbc=1&kv=-1&kak=-1&kaq=-1&kaj=m&kap=-1&kp=-2&kao=-1&kav=1&kax=-1&kay=b&k8=9e9485&kx=b8bb26&kj=32302f&k21=32302f&k9=a19276&kaa=818180&k7=1e1e1e```

## Troubleshooting
- My wallpaper is gone!
    Ensure FEH is installed and edit the line of XMonad's config that launches it setting other image path.
- When logging in, suddenly my greeter pops up again/Xorg crashes!
    Open a TTY, log in with your user and write `xmonad --recompile`. Then come back to your greeter/original tty and try again.

## Thanks to...
- [Axarva](https://github.com/Axarva) for their XMonad configuration (which has been simplified a lot).
- [Jimmy](https://github.com/Jimmysit0) for his fetch and his advices.
- [Garuda Linux Team](https://garudalinux.org/about.html) for a lot of the aliases of the `.zshrc`. (Yep, I used Garuda linux for a couple of months)

**A lot of thanks!**
